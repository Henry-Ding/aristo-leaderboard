This directory has code and data for the eQASC evaluator, as described in the EMNLP 2020 paper [Learning to Explain: Datasets and Models for Identifying Valid Reasoning Chains in Multihop Question-Answering](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Learning-to-Explain%3A-Datasets-and-Models-for-Valid-Jhamtani-Clark/ebaebfefec9d5c21a4559a1a038743bd437d2f01).

* [code](code/) holds the evaluator
* [data/](data/) holds the labels used by the evaluator
